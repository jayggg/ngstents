    "The **ngsTents** package is a c++ extension of the NGSolve finite element library, designed to ease experimentation with solvers based on spacetime tents for hyperbolic systems. A python front-end (`import ngstents`) allows new equations (linear or nonlinear conservation laws) to be solved by easily defining required fluxes and numerical fluxes in a few lines of code."

These lectures were first presented in an NGSolve User Meeting and were prepared by [Jay Gopalakrishnan](https://web.pdx.edu/~gjay/). Send all comments to gjay@pdx.edu or pull requests via [ngstents repository in GitHub](https://github.com/jayggg/ngstents). \n"
